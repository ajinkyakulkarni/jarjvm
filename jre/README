JRE class files go here. You must extract them from the JAR file so they are bare .class files.

You should be able to do this on Mac OSX by doing the following:

cd jre/
unzip /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Classes/classes.jar

When done correctly, you will have the following subfolders:
com
java
javax
org
sun
sunw
